## apg-info adapter for ioBroker
This adapter provides the peak-times for the Austrian Power Grid, where power consumption shall be avoided. In addition the adapter provides the PHELIX Day-Ahead (EPEX Spot) prices for Austria and Germany (configure in Adapter settngs). Provider fee, tax, grid costs can be added optionally in the config (tab Calculation). 
`[..].marketprice.today.jsonChart` and `[..].marketprice.tomorrow.jsonChart` can be used with https://github.com/Scrounger/ioBroker.vis-materialdesign#json-chart.  
With the standard-configuration the adapter runs at 00:00, 13:00 and 15.00 o'clock. It's highly recommended not to remove the run at 00:00, otherwise the day-change (tomorrow --> today) will nit work propperly.

**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)!
